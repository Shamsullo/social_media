## Beginning of API development for a Simple Social Media 

Dear Starnavi Team,

Here is the implementation of what you asked me to do)

I guess the instruction on how to clone and runn the project is not needed.

In ```post``` and ```users``` apps I have brought the example of unit testing

I also have included swagger to see the endpoints documentations

I would love to meet with you and discuss the work.

I used: Django, DFR, djoser and drf_yang
